# Welcome to The Army!
_The Army_ is a team for our school project affiliated with the MIT university called _HoPE_ (Hands on Physics Experience).<br>
Our team project aims to build a robotic remote controlled arm based on the amazing open source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and its boards!

## Documentation
Everything about the project's developing is documented in this GitHub organization and in [our official documentation website](https://the-army-hope.github.io/)!

## Team and contacts
 - [NexIsDumb](https://github.com/NexIsDumb) works on the connection between the arduinos, website, documentation, GitHub organization stuff, helps the other members with coding optimizations and more;
 - [Matte549](https://github.com/Matte549) works on the internal base code for the devices;
 - [Turkiztron](https://github.com/turkiz-jpg) works on internal base code for the devices as well and 3D models of the devices and their printing;
 - [Tindaniel706](https://github.com/Tindaniel706) works on 3D models of the devices and a small presentation mobile app;
 - Leggend works on the aspect side of the project while also helping the others.
