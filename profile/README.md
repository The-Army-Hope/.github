# Welcome to The Army!
_The Army_ is a team for our school project affiliated with the MIT university called _HoPE_ (Hands on Physics Experience).<br>
Our team project aims to build a robotic remote controlled arm based on the amazing open source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and its boards!

## Documentation
Everything about the project's developing is documented in this GitHub organization.<br>
_Website coming soon!_
